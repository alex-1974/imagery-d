# imagery-d

`imagery-d` is the higher-level D image and remote-sensing library of
the `d-geospatial-workspace`.

The repository begins as an architecture and research project. Production
package/API work is admitted only after a concrete image-domain capability has
passed the project's research and design gates.

## Relationship to raster-d

The dependency direction is:

```text
imagery-d
    |
    v
 raster-d
```

`raster-d` owns generic raster mechanics.

`imagery-d` owns semantics and processing that exist because the data is an
image, remote-sensing product, or imagery pipeline.

### raster-d retains

- raster regions/extents;
- sample/plane/layout and stride/interleaving mechanics;
- ownership, leases and borrowing;
- read-only and writable raster views;
- generic copy/fill/conversion;
- generic reductions;
- alias and physical-range analysis;
- generic dependency/halo mechanics;
- generic tile/window/streaming contracts;
- bounded-residency execution;
- generic cache primitives.

### imagery-d owns or researches

- image and pixel-format semantics;
- channel and colour semantics;
- radiometric processing;
- colour/exposure/radiometric normalization;
- image filters and neighbourhood operators;
- mosaics and image pyramids;
- image-quality analysis;
- imagery-specific source/cache policy;
- image-oriented scheduling and progressive refinement;
- imagery-specific geospatial metadata integration;
- imagery benchmark corpus management;
- later feature extraction, segmentation and ML-assisted interpretation.

Generic raster functionality must not be reimplemented here merely for API
convenience.

## Origin

The original repository named `imagery-d` evolved into a generic raster engine.

On 2026-09-22 that repository and its history were deliberately pivoted to
`raster-d`.

This repository is the new higher-level image-domain consumer anticipated by
that pivot. It does not inherit ownership of the generic raster core.

Relevant historical evidence remains in the `raster-d` repository, including
its pre-pivot architecture, research, benchmarks and ADRs.

## Current status

**RESEARCH / ARCHITECTURE ONLY**

There is intentionally no `dub.sdl` and no production `source/` tree yet.

The first package surface will be created only after:

1. the inherited imagery research has been classified;
2. the first concrete image-domain consumer/capability has been selected;
3. its relationship to `raster-d` is explicit;
4. public semantics have been researched before API freeze;
5. correctness and benchmark strategy are defined.

## Documents

- `DESIGN.md` — current image-engine architecture constraints;
- `RESEARCH.md` — active and deferred imagery research;
- `ROADMAP.md` — admission sequence;
- `BENCHMARK.md` — benchmark/corpus principles;
- `docs/adr/0001-library-boundary-and-raster-dependency.md` — initial boundary;
- `docs/research/handover-from-raster-d.md` — extracted historical knowledge.

## Workspace context

When developed inside `d-geospatial-workspace`, current shared workspace
context is available locally under:

    .workspace/

These files are hard links to the canonical workspace documents and are not
part of the `imagery-d` repository or published package.

Repository-root documentation remains specific to `imagery-d`.

The helper:

    tools/link-workspace-docs.sh

creates or verifies the local `.workspace/` hard links. It deliberately refuses
to overwrite an existing file that is not already the expected workspace
hard link.

## Benchmark imagery

Large satellite, aerial and other test imagery is not committed to Git.

The repository will store reproducible scene/source definitions, retrieval
metadata, provenance and content hashes. Local imagery belongs below `data/`
or another ignored local cache.
