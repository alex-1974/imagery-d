# Changelog

## Unreleased — RGB histogram source API (ADR 0007 accepted)

- RGB8 per-channel histograms and ROI statistics with explicit binary selection.
- Require raster-d v0.3.x; unmasked counts reuse its generic `histogram256`.
- Masked counts retain checked image-selection traversal; results publish only
  on success. No change to the published imagery-d v0.1.0 release.

## v0.1.0 — Initial release

- Candidate scalar Levels owned-result API for already materialized image channels; `@safe` through one narrowly reviewed `@trusted` malloc/adoption step.
- Explicit `LevelsError.notAttempted` invalid-success default, returned-failure publication semantics and required result pixel-payload budget.
- Scalar gamma-2 sqrt specialization; independent Decimal oracle regression covering 624 deterministic cases, including extreme finite float/selection cancellation.
- Real P6 and paired native Release consumers, rendered DDox, DIP1000 and non-exposed Into negative compile gates.
- Source-archive DUB consumer verified outside the Git checkout on DMD/LDC, Debug/Release.
- General-image scope (ADR 0005), first Levels priority (ADR 0004) and
  narrow source-API acceptance (ADR 0006) are documented.
- Initial Linux x86-64 release; macOS and Windows are best effort.
- Pre-1.0 source compatibility may change in future minor versions;
  no stable ABI is promised.
